TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
# Review
- In coding counting begins from 0
- When choosing a certain dictionary type the script in ""

# Binary Search: 
- Binary search look through an algorithm to find the target value

## Understanding the code in Exercise 2: 
- guess = false as assigning anything to false ensures that in a while loop it is not executed and what is 'true' is only executed

## New Content Learnt
- __while True__: The while loop will run as long as the conditional expression evaluates to True.
- __while False__: 
- __string.isnumeric()__ checks whether all characters within the string is a number or not. 
- __math.floor__ rounds the number to the nearest integer
