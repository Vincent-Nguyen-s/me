## Conditions
- % known as the modulo division which calculates the remainder 
- _if_ 'blah blah': 
    _if_ 'BLAH BLAH' 
    return " "
means when the scenario occurs and the second scenario occur print " " 
- _else_: 
    return "1"
means if none of the conditions does not occur print "1"
- _elif_ " ": 
means if the first condition does not occur test for second condition
### Reflection on Conditions
- For the odd and even exercise I did not take long to complete as it could be obtained from google easily
- For the conditions it took more thinking to understand how each command works but was doable
## Looping

### Reflection on Looping 
- __Loop 1a and 1c__ I had the most trouble with the looping section. I was able to make a list of 10 '*' but I couldn't return a list of 10 *. Although, after a while I discovered list comprehensions which helped return the list of 10.
- __Loop 2__ 
- __Loop 3__
- __Loop 4__
- __Loop 5__
- __Loop 6__
- __Loop 7__
