TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Notes on Exercise 0
- Do not overthink the commands and when writing codes think of it as once one step has cleared the next will occur.

# Notes on Exercise 2

## Debugging 
- I realised the usefulness of the debugging console as we are able to identify errors in the code and fix them as well as test the code out to see if it printed the right outcome.

# Notes on Exercise 3 

## Conditions
- % known as the modulo division which calculates the remainder 
- _if_ 'blah blah': 
    _if_ 'BLAH BLAH' 
    return " "
means when the scenario occurs and the second scenario occur print " " 
- _else_: 
    return "1"
means if none of the conditions does not occur print "1"
- _elif_ " ": 
means if the first condition does not occur test for second condition
### Reflection on Conditions
- For the odd and even exercise I did not take long to complete as it could be obtained from google easily
- For the conditions it took more thinking to understand how each command works but was doable
## Looping 
- For () in (): 
- != : does not equal 
- >= : more than/equal to 
- <= : less than/equal to 
- == : equals to 
### Reflection on Looping 
- __Loop 1a and 1c__ I had the most trouble with the looping section. I was able to make a list of 10 '*' but I couldn't return a list of 10 *. Although, after a while I discovered list comprehensions which helped return the list of 10.
- __Loop 2 and 3__ I was able to understand the use of range() function and apply it to the other loops
- __Loop 4 5 and 6__ 
- __Loop 7__ This was the challenge exercise. The biggest struggle I had was ensuring that the correct number of stars printed in the 1, 3, 5 etc. pattern. After I figured the pattern I was able to create the empty strings to create the pyramid.

# Summary
- I believe that I still have heaps to learn in looping and condensing my codes into fewer lines.
