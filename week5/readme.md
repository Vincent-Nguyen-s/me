# Lectures 
- Data Project

# Refactoring 
- Refactoring involves simplifying codes whilst still making sense
- In the exercises I struggled with the wordy pyramid, I knew it had to be simplified using the word generator but I could not get the code to work 
- Solution: Yet to be found

# Recursion 
- Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
