TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
# Lecture Notes
- Requests is a library which allows obtaining information from the internet easier

# Reflection on Exercises 

## Get some details
- son_data pulls the data out - n/ means new lines
### Learning Outcomes
- how to search through a dictionary to find output certain data

## Wordy Pyramid
- the pyramid task was similar to the tasks given for week 2
- the difference was that we had to import a link which generates the word for us 
- the code was able to be concise by defining the word generator before 
### Learning Outcomes
- how to import url into the code, however I am still not confident on achieving this alone

## Pokedex
- in this exercise it involved reading into the json which I found difficult as I could not concentrate and interpret the json but using the link provided it assisted with reading the it
### Learning Outcomes
- being able to sort through a json in a more coherent manner
